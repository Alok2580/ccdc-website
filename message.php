                            What is also encouraging is the studentsâ€™ participation in various technological, innovative ventures, and socio-cultural events in national and international events, considering the importance of these experiences in shaping up their personalities as individuals. IIT Patna invites the recruiters to the Campus Recruitment Programme and gives this batch of graduating students an opportunity to prove themselves and add value to the organisations they join. We hope this will be a pleasant experience for the recruiters and a step forward in improving upon the past relations and building up new ones. I welcome you to become a part of our story and to form a long-lasting association with the institute. Prof. T.N. Singh, Director, Indian Institute of Technology Patna
